This project corresponds to lab 5 of the Python Automation class.
In this project, we are tasked to create an AWS Lambda function that
add new instances to CheckMK, using ``requests``, ``boto3``, and the
``json`` module.

Bonus round: Write a function that removes a host from CheckMK when
the status changes to Terminating.
